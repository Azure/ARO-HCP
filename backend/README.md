# ARO-HCP-BACKEND

## Development Workflow

The Backend can be built and tested locally and in personal DEV environments using a set of Makefile targets.

- **make run:** runs the Backend binary locally
- **make deploy:** builds the Backend container image, uploads it to the DEV service ACR and deploys it to a personal DEV cluster

The `Makefile` has access to a set of environment variables representing configuration from the `config/config.yaml` file. The environment variables are made available via the `include ../setup-templatize-env.mk` directive in the `Makefile`, which processes and includes the [Env.mk](Env.mk) file. This is the file you need to modify to provide additional environment variables fueled by `config.yaml`.

### Local Run

Using the `make run` target, the Backend binary can be run locally.

### Personal DEV Environment deployment

The local code can also be deployed directly into a personal DEV environment by running `make deploy`. Understand that this requires such an environment to be created first via `make entrypoint/Region` from the root of the repository.

`make deploy` builds a custom developer image from the local code and uploads it to the DEV service ACR (`arohcpsvcdev`) into a developer specific repository. This way developer images will not conflict with other develooper images or CI built ones. The actual deployment is delegated to the pipeline/AdminAPI target in the root of the repository, providing a configuration override for `frontend.image.repository` and `frontend.image.digest` respectively.

## Deployment

The [pipeline.yaml](pipeline.yaml) file in this directory contains the pipeline definition for the Backend. It is integrated into the [topology.yaml](../topology.yaml) file and runs as part of the service cluster deployment.
