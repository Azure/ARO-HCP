# ARO HCP Admin API

## Overview

Dislcaimer: As the Admin API is currently mostly a stub, so is this README.

The ARO HCP Admin API is a REST API deployed on each regional service cluster, offering a set of endpoints for administrative tasks for SREs and platform operators invoked via Geneva Actions.

## Development Workflow

The Admin API can be built and tested locally and in personal DEV environments using a set of Makefile targets.

- **make run:** runs the Admin API binary locally
- **make deploy:** builds the admin API container image, uploads it to the DEV service ACR and deploys it to a personal DEV cluster

The `Makefile` has access to a set of environment variables representing configuration from the `config/config.yaml` file. The environment variables are made available via the `include ../setup-templatize-env.mk` directive in the `Makefile`, which processes and includes the [Env.mk](Env.mk) file. This is the file you need to modify to provide additional environment variables fueled by `config.yaml`.

### Local Run

Using the `make run` target, the Admin API binary can be run locally. At this point, the Admin API does not integrate with any other service like the RP Fronent, CS or Maestro. Hence there are no dedicated dependencies on infrastructure that need to be met upfront. This will change soon.

### Personal DEV Environment deployment

The local code can also be deployed directly into a personal DEV environment by running `make deplioy`. Understand that this requires such an environment to be created first via `make entrypoint/Region` from the root of the repository.

`make deploy` builds a custom developer image from the local code and uploads it to the DEV service ACR (`arohcpsvcdev`) into a developer specific repository. This way developer images will not conflict with other develooper images or CI built ones. The actual deployment is delegated to the pipeline/AdminAPI target in the root of the repository, providing a configuration override for `adminApi.image.repository` and `adminApi.image.digest` respectively.

## Deployment

The [pipeline.yaml](pipeline.yaml) file in this directory contains the pipeline definition for the Admin API. It is integrated into the [topology.yaml](../topology.yaml) file and runs as part of the service cluster deployment.
