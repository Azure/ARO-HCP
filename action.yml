# Custom install of the azure-cli
# Note that the azure-cli ships out of the box with ubuntu-latest for
# github actions runs.  This allows us to pin a version and also allows us
# to use commands that aren't present in the azure/cli github action that's
# published to the GitHub actions marketplace.
# Follows instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux
