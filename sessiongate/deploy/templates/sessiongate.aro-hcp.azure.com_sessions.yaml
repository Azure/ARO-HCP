                  Standard condition types include:

                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state
                  - "Credentials": credentials are being provisioned or ready

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
