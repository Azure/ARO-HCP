          SecurityContextConstraints governs the ability to make requests that affect the SecurityContext
          that will be applied to a container.
          For historical reasons SCC was exposed under the core Kubernetes API group.
          That exposure is deprecated and will be removed in a future release - users
          should instead use the security.openshift.io group to manage
          SecurityContextConstraints.

          Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

                  cloudConfig is a reference to a ConfigMap containing the cloud provider configuration file.
                  This configuration file is used to configure the Kubernetes cloud provider integration
                  when using the built-in cloud provider integration or the external cloud controller manager.
                  The namespace for this config map is openshift-config.

                  cloudConfig should only be consumed by the kube_cloud_config controller.
                  The controller is responsible for using the user configuration in the spec
                  for various platforms and combining that with the user provided ConfigMap in this field
                  to create a stitched kube cloud config.
                  The controller generates a ConfigMap `kube-cloud-config` in `openshift-config-managed` namespace
                  with the kube cloud config is stored in `cloud.conf` key.
                  All the clients are expected to use the generated ConfigMap only.

                                    any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                    the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                    "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                    exists or not.
